## Installation

    pip install napari-biomag-annotator

On Linux distributions, the following error may arise upon napari startup after the installation of the plugin: `Could not load the Qt platform plugin “xcb” in “” even though it was found`. In this case, the manual install of `libxcb-xinerama0` for Qt is required:

    sudo apt install libxcb-xinerama0

### Bundled napari app
The bundled application version of [napari](https://github.com/napari/napari/releases) allows the pip install of plugins in the .zip distribution. After installation of this release, napari-annotatorj can be installed from the `Plugins --> Install/Uninstall plugins...` menu by searching for its name and clicking on the `Install` button next to it.

### Script
Single-file install is supported on [**Windows**](#windows) and [Linux](#linux) (currently). It will create a virtual environment named `napariAnnotatorEnv` in the parent folder of the cloned repository, install the package via pip and start napari. It requires a valid Python install.
